List of suspected incidents as stated in the technical reports:

	A1: AWstats incident:
	 	@ Associated IP addresses: (213.135.2.227)
	 	@ Number of logged events: (http_access: 2) (http_error: 16) (SnortSysLog: 9)
	 	@ Notes: - The events in http_access include encoded commands which download a malicious file from a
					 website(http://www.shady.go.ro/aw.tgz).
				 - The related messages in http_error show that the attack was successful, also the response state is 200 (successful)
	 	@ HTTP status codes: [200]
-------------------------------------
	A2: AWstats incident:
	 	@ Associated IP addresses: (82.55.78.243)
	 	@ Number of logged events: (http_access: 1) (http_error: 16) (SnortSysLog: 6)
	 	@ Notes: - The event in http_access includes an encoded command which downloads a malicious file from a
					 website(http://www.shady.go.ro/aw.tgz).
				 - The related messages in http_error show that the attack was successful, also the response state is 200 (successful)
				 - The request and results in A2 are the same as A1, also those two attacks were performed in
					 short time. (Thus, A1 and A2 might be the same attack but from different IP addresses)
	 	@ HTTP status codes: [200]
-------------------------------------
	A3: AWstats incident:
	 	@ Associated IP addresses: (212.203.66.69)
	 	@ Number of logged events: (http_access: 13) (http_error: 135) (SnortSysLog: 29)
	 	@ Notes: - The events in http_access include encoded commands which perform different commands and
					 queries such as checking for files (by using the commands "uname -a" and "cat /etc/issue"),
					 also download malicious files from different websites (www.adjud.go.ro/t.tgz, www.maveric.com/t.tgz)
					 by using the commands "Lynx" and "wget".
				 - The events response in http_access state the code 200 (successful)
				 - There is a time difference between events in http_access and the related events in http_error, that might
					 be because the files took some time to download on the victim device, or because the connection fails or timeout.
				 - The lynx command did not work on the victim device, error messages show that in http_error.
				 - The connection via "wget" to the website "www.adjud.go.ro" timed out, thus the malicious file was not
					 downloaded on the victim device. Report 1, states that for this reason, the attack was not successful.
	 	@ HTTP status codes: [200]
-------------------------------------
	A4: AWstats incident:
	 	@ Associated IP addresses: (82.49.16.150)
	 	@ Number of logged events: (http_access: 2) (http_error: 14)
	 	@ Notes: - The events in http_access include encoded commands which perform two different commands such as shutting-down
					 the "netd" service by using the command "Killall -9 inetd", also download malicious files from different,
					 also downloading a malicious file from a website(www.shady.go.ro/a.tgz) by using the command "wget".
				 - The events response in http_access state the code 200 (successful)
				 - There is a strong similarity between this attack and the A1 attack. The attacker started the "inetd" service in
					 the A1 attack, while he shut it sown in this attack. Also, the same website (www.shady.go.ro) was used to download
					 the file on the victim device, which indicates the same attacker might be responsible for both attacks.
				 - The http_error file shows that the file was downloaded on the victim device, although there was a problem
					 binding a program to a port. Report1 states that this indicates that the desired port was used by other
					 application or that the command "killall" did not work on the victim device.

	A5: AWstats scans:
	 	@ Associated IP addresses: (210.51.12.238)

	 	@ Notes: - The related events in http_access are "| id |" commands that performs scans on the AWstats script.
				 - The events response states in http_access are 404(Not Found), 403(Forbidden), 200(successful).
				 - Report1 states that no intrusion of the system took place by those commands (scanning commands only).
				 - The entry involves access attempt to "/var/www/html" which is forbidden by the server.

	 	@ Number of logged events: (syslog_secure: 1) (syslog_messages: 4)

	 	@ Number of logged events: (syslog_maillog: 14)
		@ Notes: Several relay attempts found in the log file. None of them were successful (Based on report1)
-------------------------------------

	 	@ Number of logged events: (syslog_maillog: 5)
		@ Notes: Aliases were rebuilt and the Sendmail daemon restarted,
				  this correlates with the reboot. (No indicator to malicious activity)
